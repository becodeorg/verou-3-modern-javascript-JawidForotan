One of those properties is script.\r Scripts can be used to create shortcuts in the command prompt/shell.\r Remember before? We already used this to run a bundler.\r \"scripts\": {\r ...\r \"build\": \"webpack\"\r },\r Add a property build to your script (see above) and try to build and run your project in your terminal with the script shortcuts\r npm run build\r or\r yarn build",
